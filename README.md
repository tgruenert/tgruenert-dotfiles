Tools will create `~/.kube-multi` directory. Put your cluster configfiles into this directory and restart your shell. kubectl will recognize the new files. To remove config-files just remove it from this directory. kubectl will recognize this immediately.

If you use Lens

Now Lens can detect all your config files.
